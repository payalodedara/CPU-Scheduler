# CPU-Scheduler

This project implements an advanced CPU scheduler in C++ that manages the execution of processes using various scheduling algorithms. The scheduler decides which process should utilize the CPU and for how long, ensuring efficient resource utilization and balancing factors like throughput, response time, and fairness. The project includes a sophisticated frontend that visualizes the scheduling decisions and displays various performance metrics.

Dependencies
C++17, 
SFML 2.5.1 (for frontend visualization)
